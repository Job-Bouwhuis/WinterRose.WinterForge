# WinterRose.Reflection

**Powerful reflection utilities for runtime type inspection, dynamic member access, anonymous type generation, and type conversion.**

This package is used internally by 
[WinterForge](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WinterRose.WinterForge), 
and exposes a range of advanced runtime features including:
- Unified member access (fields, properties, runtime dictionaries on the Anonymous class in this package)
- Runtime-generated types with real property access (no `dynamic`)
- inteligent type conversion between arbitrary types and collections using Converter classes, and the ability to take multiple conversion steps
- Support for `implicit operator` and custom conversion pipelines

**Documentation is coming after the summer holiday!**

I'm currently on holiday, but proper README usage examples and in-depth docs will be published soon.  
Until then, feel free to explore the source code and poke around! If you're curious, the features are already being used in [WinterForge](https://github.com/WinterRose/WinterForge), which is fully documented.
